## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before delivering any solution:
- [ ] Solution meets all stated requirements
- [ ] Code follows language-specific best practices
- [ ] Comprehensive testing has been implemented
- [ ] Security considerations have been addressed
- [ ] Documentation is complete and clear
- [ ] Platform-specific requirements are met
- [ ] Potential edge cases have been considered
- [ ] Long-term maintenance implications have been evaluated

## Good practices for stacks: React, TypeScript, Node.js 
- **Test Command**: `npm test`
- **Lint Command**: `npm run lint`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Code Style**:
 - TypeScript strict mode enabled
 - Prefer `interface` over `type` (except unions/intersections)
 - No `any` - use `unknown` instead
 - Use early returns, avoid nested conditionals
 - Prefer composition over inheritance
- **UI States**:
 - Always handle: loading, error, empty, success states
 - Show loading ONLY when no data exists
 - Every list needs an empty state
- **Mutations**:
 - Disable buttons during async operations
 - Show loading indicator on buttons
 - Always have onError handler with user feedback
- **Common Commands**:
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm test             # Run tests
npm run lint         # Run linter
npm run typecheck    # Check types

# Git
npm run commit       # Interactive commit
gh pr create         # Create PR
```

## Good Practice to Adopt for Development
**Test-Driven Development**:
- Write failing test first (TDD)
- Use factory pattern: `getMockX(overrides)`
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Run tests before committing

## Continuous Improvement

After each task:
- Reflect on what went well and what could be improved
- Identify new patterns or approaches that could be applied to future tasks
- Consider how the solution could be optimized further
- Update your approach based on lessons learned

### Your UI/UX Aesthetic Design Pledge

- **Anti-Generic:** Every interface will have a distinctive conceptual direction—no template aesthetics, no "safe" defaults. You will reject "safe" templates and "AI slop."
- **Uniqueness:** Strive for bespoke layouts, asymmetry, and distinctive typography.
- **Library Discipline:** Shadcn/Radix primitives as foundation, styled to achieve the vision—never redundant rebuilds
- **Prohibition:** **NEVER** use surface-level logic. If the reasoning feels easy, dig deeper until the logic is irrefutable.
- **Intentional Minimalism:** Reduction is the ultimate sophistication. You will apply my preference for "Avant-Garde" UI with "Intentional Minimalism," ensuring that whitespace and hierarchy speak louder than decoration.
- **The "Why" Factor:** Every element earns its place through calculated purpose. If you cannot justify an element's existence, you will delete it.
- **Maximum Depth:** You must engage in exhaustive, deep-level reasoning. If your reasoning feels easy, you will dig until it's irrefutable
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis:** Analyze the request through every lens:
    1.  *Psychological:* User sentiment and cognitive load.
    2.  *Technical:* Rendering performance, repaint/reflow costs, and state complexity.
    3.  *Accessibility:* WCAG AAA strictness.
    4. *Scalability:* Long-term maintenance and modularity.
- **Transparent Partnership:** I will see your thinking, your trade-off analysis, your concerns—nothing hidden.
- **You will reject convergence toward:**
    1. Inter/Roboto/system font safety
    2. Purple-gradient-on-white clichés  
    3. Predictable card grids and hero sections
    4. The homogenized "AI slop" aesthetic

## FRONTEND CODING STANDARDS
*   **Library Discipline (CRITICAL):** If a UI library (e.g., Shadcn UI, Radix, MUI) is detected or active in the project, **YOU MUST USE IT**.
    *   **Do not** build custom components (like modals, dropdowns, or buttons) from scratch if the library provides them.
    *   **Do not** pollute the codebase with redundant CSS.
    *   *Exception:* You may wrap or style library components to achieve the "Avant-Garde" look, but the underlying primitive must come from the library to ensure stability and accessibility.
*   **Stack:** Modern (React/Vue/Svelte), Tailwind/Custom CSS, semantic HTML5.
*   **Visuals:** Focus on micro-interactions, perfect spacing, and "invisible" UX.

**Consciously apply:**
1.  **Deep Reasoning Chain:** (Detailed breakdown of the architectural and design decisions).
2.  **Edge Case Analysis:** (What could go wrong and how we prevented it).
3.  **The Code:** (Optimized, bespoke, production-ready, utilizing existing libraries).

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity. Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Design Pledge

You commit to the **Anti-Generic** philosophy:
*   **Rejection of Safety:** No predictable Bootstrap-style grids. No safe "Inter/Roboto" pairings without distinct typographical hierarchy.
*   **Intentional Minimalism:** You will use whitespace as a structural element, not just empty space.
*   **Deep Reasoning:** You will analyze the *psychological* impact of the UI, the *rendering* performance of the DOM, and the *scalability* of the codebase before writing a single line.
*   **Mode:** Elite / Meticulous / Avant-Garde.

You will commit boldly - whether that's brutalist restraint, editorial asymmetry, retro-futurism, or refined luxury—and execute with precision. Applying the above framework consistently, you will deliver solutions that demonstrate exceptional technical excellence, thorough planning, and transparent communication—ensuring optimal outcomes for every project.

## 4. Key Components

### 4.1 Domain Models (`src/neural_terminal/domain/models.py`)

| Class | Purpose | Key Attributes |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `MessageRole` | Enum: user/assistant/system | - |
| `ConversationStatus` | Enum: active/archived/forked | - |
| `TokenUsage` | Immutable token metrics | `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `total_tokens` |
| `Message` | Domain entity for chat messages | `id`, `role`, `content`, `token_usage`, `cost`, `latency_ms` |
| `Conversation` | Aggregate root | `id`, `title`, `total_cost`, `total_tokens`, `update_cost()` |

**Phase 0 Defect Fixes in Models:**
- C-1: `TokenUsage.calculate_cost()` converted from property to method
- H-1: `Conversation.update_cost()` uses simple assignment
- H-4: Added `to_dict()` for JSON serialization

### 4.2 Domain Exceptions (`src/neural_terminal/domain/exceptions.py`)

**Hierarchy:**
```
NeuralTerminalError (base)
├── ConfigurationError
├── ValidationError
│   ├── InputTooLongError
│   └── EmptyInputError
├── CircuitBreakerOpenError
├── APIError
│   ├── OpenRouterAPIError
│   │   ├── RateLimitError
│   │   ├── ModelUnavailableError
│   │   └── TokenLimitError
├── ServiceError
│   ├── ConversationNotFoundError
│   └── MessageNotFoundError
├── BudgetError
│   └── BudgetExceededError
```

All exceptions include:
- `message`: Human-readable description
- `code`: Machine-readable error code (e.g., `HTTP_429`, `CIRCUIT_OPEN`)

### 4.3 Infrastructure Layer

#### Database (`infrastructure/database.py`)

**ORM Models:**
- `ConversationORM`: Maps to `conversations` table
- `MessageORM`: Maps to `messages` table

**Production Optimizations (PRAGMAs):**
```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON          -- Enforce FK constraints
PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL         -- Write-Ahead Logging
PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL       -- Balance safety/performance
PRAGMA cache_size=-64000        -- 64MB cache
PRAGMA temp_store=MEMORY        -- Fast temp operations
PRAGMA mmap_size=268435456      -- 256MB memory-mapped I/O
```

**Phase 0 Defect C-2 Fix:**
- Engine created BEFORE event listener
- Listen on ENGINE INSTANCE, not `create_engine` function

#### Repositories (`infrastructure/repositories.py`)

**Pattern:** Abstract base + SQLite implementation

**SQLiteConversationRepository Methods:**
- `get_by_id(conversation_id)` → Optional[Conversation]
- `get_messages(conversation_id)` → List[Message] *(ordered by created_at ASC)*
- `save(conversation)` → Upsert via `session.merge()`
- `add_message(message)` → Insert with validation
- `list_active(limit, offset)` → List by updated_at DESC

**Phase 0 Defect C-3 Fix:**
- Replaced broken context manager with `_session_scope()`
- Proper `SessionLocal.remove()` cleanup in finally block
- Added `_message_to_domain()` converter

#### OpenRouter Client (`infrastructure/openrouter.py`)

**Capabilities:**
- Async streaming via `chat_completion_stream()`
- SSE parsing with `json` module
- Error handling: 429 (RateLimit), 503 (ModelUnavailable), 400 (TokenLimit)
- Pricing model fetching via `get_available_models()`

**Phase 0 Defects Fixed:**
- C-4: Yields directly; connection errors surface before first yield
- C-5: `json` module imported at top of file

#### Circuit Breaker (`infrastructure/circuit_breaker.py`)

**States:** CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN → CLOSED

**Configuration:**
- `failure_threshold`: 5 failures before opening (default)
- `recovery_timeout`: 30 seconds before HALF_OPEN

**Thread Safety:**
- `threading.Lock()` around all state mutations (Phase 0 Defect H-2 Fix)
- `_check_state()` for manual circuit verification (Phase 0 Defect C-4)

**Usage Patterns:**
- Sync: `circuit.call(func, *args, **kwargs)`
- Async: `await circuit.call_async(func, *args, **kwargs)`
- Streaming: Manual `_check_state()` → iterate → `_on_success()`/`_on_failure()`

#### Token Counter (`infrastructure/token_counter.py`)

**Features:**
- Model-aware encoding via tiktoken
- Context truncation with system message preservation
- Caching of encoder instances

**Supported Encodings:**
- GPT-4/GPT-3.5: `cl100k_base`
- Claude: `cl100k_base` (approximation)
- Default: `cl100k_base`

**Truncation Strategy:**
1. Always keep system message (if first)
2. Keep recent messages from end
3. Add truncation marker if messages dropped

### 4.4 Application Layer

#### ChatOrchestrator (`application/orchestrator.py`)

**Responsibilities:**
- Conversation lifecycle management
- Message streaming coordination
- Cost calculation with pricing data
- Context length management

**Key Method: `send_message()`**
```python
async def send_message(
    conversation_id: UUID,
    content: str,
    temperature: float = 0.7
) -> AsyncGenerator[Tuple[str, Optional[dict]], None]
```

Yields: `(delta_text, None)` for streaming, `("", metadata)` for completion

**Phase 0 Defect C-4 Implementation:**
- Manual circuit breaker check before streaming
- Direct async generator iteration
- Manual success/failure recording

#### Event System (`application/events.py`)

**Event Types:**
```python
class Events:
    MESSAGE_STARTED = "message.started"
    TOKEN_GENERATED = "token.generated"
    MESSAGE_COMPLETED = "message.completed"
    BUDGET_THRESHOLD = "budget.threshold"
    BUDGET_EXCEEDED = "budget.exceeded"
    CONTEXT_TRUNCATED = "context.truncated"
```

**Pattern:** Observer with typed subscribers + global subscribers
- Error isolation: subscriber failures don't stop propagation
- Thread-safe event emission

#### CostTracker (`application/cost_tracker.py`)

**Implements:** `EventObserver`

**Features:**
- Real-time cost estimation during streaming
- Budget threshold warnings (80%)
- Budget exceeded enforcement

**Phase 0 Defect C-6 Fix:**
- EventBus injected via constructor (not created as orphan)

### 4.5 UI Components

#### Themes (`components/themes.py`)

**Available Themes:**

| Theme | Mode | Primary Accent | Font Stack |
|-------|------|----------------|------------|
| Terminal Green | TERMINAL | `#00FF41` (Matrix) | JetBrains Mono, Fira Code |
| Cyberpunk Amber | TERMINAL | `#FFB000` (Amber) | VT323, Share Tech Mono |
| Minimal Dark | DARK | `#569CD6` (Blue) | SF Mono, Consolas |

**Theme Structure:**
- `ColorPalette`: 17 color tokens
- `Typography`: 6 font sizes + line height
- `Spacing`: 6 scale tokens (xs to xxl)
- `Effects`: glow, scanlines, cursor blink, CRT flicker

#### Styles (`components/styles.py`)

**CSS Generation Functions:**
- `generate_base_css()`: Streamlit component overrides
- `generate_terminal_effects_css()`: Glow, cursor, scanlines
- `generate_message_css()`: Message bubble styling
- `generate_header_css()`: Header component styles
- `generate_input_css()`: Input area styling
- `generate_status_bar_css()`: Status bar styles

**Injection:** `inject_css(theme)` - Uses `st.markdown(unsafe_allow_html=True)`

#### MessageRenderer (`components/message_renderer.py`)

**Security:**
- Bleach sanitization with allowlists
- HTML escaping for inline content
- Safe markdown processing

**Allowed Tags:**
```python
['p', 'br', 'strong', 'em', 'code', 'pre', 'ul', 'ol', 'li',
 'a', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6', 'blockquote',
 'hr', 'table', 'thead', 'tbody', 'tr', 'th', 'td']
```

**Code Block Detection:**
- Fenced blocks: ```language\ncode\n```
- Inline code: `code`
- Language aliases (py→python, js→javascript, etc.)

#### Stream Bridge (`components/stream_bridge.py`)

**Problem:** Streamlit runs its own event loop; `asyncio.run()` conflicts

**Solution:** `run_async(coro)`
- Detects running loop
- If in loop: runs coroutine in thread
- If no loop: uses `asyncio.run()` directly

**StreamlitStreamBridge:**
- Producer-consumer pattern with threading
- Queue-based async-to-sync bridge
- Error propagation from async generator

1. **Builder stage:** Install Poetry, compile dependencies
2. **Runtime stage:** Copy packages, run as non-root user

**Security Features:**
- Non-root user (`neural`, UID 1000)
- `no-new-privileges:true`
- Health check endpoint
- Read-only root (writable `/app/data` volume)

### Docker Commands

```bash
# Build image
make docker-build

# Run container
make docker-run OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-...

# Docker Compose
make docker-compose-up   # Start with persistent storage
make docker-compose-down # Stop
```

### Docker Compose Configuration

```yaml
services:
  neural-terminal:
    image: neural-terminal:latest
    ports:
      - "7860:7860"
    environment:
      - OPENROUTER_API_KEY=${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}
      - DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////app/data/neural_terminal.db
    volumes:
      - neural_terminal_data:/app/data
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '2.0'
          memory: 2G
```

### Persistent Storage

**Volume:** `neural_terminal_data` (named Docker volume)

**Contents:**
- `/app/data/neural_terminal.db` - Main database
- `/app/data/neural_terminal.db-wal` - WAL file
- `/app/data/neural_terminal.db-shm` - Shared memory

---

## 9. Scripts

python scripts/init_db.py --stats      # Show statistics only
```

### health_check.py

**Purpose:** Database health monitoring

**Checks:**
- Integrity (corruption detection)
- Foreign key violations
- File sizes (warn if >1GB)
- WAL size (warn if >100MB)
- Performance metrics (conversation/message counts)

## 10. Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Phase 0 Defects (Documented in Code)

All documented as inline comments with `Phase 0 Defect X-X Fix/Note`:

| Defect | Location | Status | Description |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| C-1 | domain/models.py | ✅ Fixed | `TokenUsage.cost` property → method |
| C-2 | infrastructure/database.py | ✅ Fixed | Event listener on engine instance |
| C-3 | infrastructure/repositories.py | ✅ Fixed | Proper session scope context manager |
| C-4 | infrastructure/openrouter.py | ✅ Fixed | Async generator yield pattern |
| C-5 | infrastructure/openrouter.py | ✅ Fixed | `json` import at top level |
| C-6 | application/cost_tracker.py | ✅ Fixed | EventBus injection (not orphan) |
| H-1 | domain/models.py | ✅ Fixed | `update_cost()` simple assignment |
| H-2 | infrastructure/circuit_breaker.py | ✅ Fixed | Threading lock for state |
| H-3 | components/stream_bridge.py | ✅ Fixed | Async-to-sync bridge pattern |
| H-4 | domain/models.py | ✅ Fixed | `to_dict()` for serialization |
| H-5 | infrastructure/repositories.py | ✅ Fixed | Added `get_messages()` method |

### Current Limitations

1. **Database:** SQLite only (PostgreSQL support planned)
2. **Conversation Delete:** Soft-delete not implemented (only removes from list)
3. **Model Pricing:** Cached on load, not refreshed during session
4. **Search:** No full-text search on conversation content
5. **Export:** No conversation export functionality
6. **Multi-user:** Single-user design (no authentication system)

### Development Notes

- **Streamlit Limitations:** Requires async-to-sync bridge for streaming
- **Thread Safety:** All state mutations use `threading.Lock()`
- **Event Loop:** Cannot use `asyncio.run()` inside Streamlit; use `run_async()`
- **Session State:** JSON serialization requires Decimal/UUID conversion

### Performance Considerations

- Message history limited to 100 visible messages in UI
- Context truncation at 4096 tokens (configurable per model)
- Database connection pooling via SQLAlchemy
- WAL mode for concurrent read/write
- Token encoder caching in TokenCounter
